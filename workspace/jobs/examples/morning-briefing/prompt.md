# Morning Briefing

Read the evidence file and deliver a concise morning briefing.

## Format

Keep it scannable. Use this structure:

**Calendar** — What's on today? Flag anything in the next 2 hours.

**Weather** — One line. Only mention if it affects plans (rain, extreme temps).

**Priority Emails** — Flag anything that needs a response before noon.

**Suggested Focus** — Based on what's on the calendar, suggest what to
focus on first.

## Rules

- Keep the whole briefing under 10 lines
- Only surface what's actionable
- If nothing is urgent, say so: "Clear morning. No fires."
- Use the user's timezone from jobs/config.conf
